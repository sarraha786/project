			<h2>Hi There!</h2>
			<p> I am majoring in Information Analysis through the School of Information and minoring in Public Policy. I am interested in studying law post
				grad and purusing tech law! On this page I will walk you through my professional history and some of my personal interests.</p>

			<h2>Past Work Experience</h2>
			<p> I have been involved in politics since high school. My first camapaign was Abdul El-Sayed's run for Michigan Governor in 2018. Since then,
				I have worked on Congresswomen Elissa Slotkin and Haley Steven's respective campaigns for congress along with Abdullah Hammoud's hisoric run for Mayor in Dearborn. I have also dabbled 
				in political data and served on two small North Carolina campaigns as a data specialist. For the 2022 midterm election, I was an associate for a political consulting firm in Washington D.C. and got the opportunity to work on 14 different campaigns at once.
				Most notably, I contributed to Governor Tony Evers' big win in Wisconsin, Governor Janet Mills' win in Maine, and Congressman Andy Kim's win in New Jersey's third district.

			<h2>College So Far</h2>
			<p> My interests are very diverse and I am stuyding Information Analytics because SI's approach to programming makes sense to me
				as someone who is interested in data as a means of civic engagement that positively affects communities. Oddly enough, my curriculum in my policy minor
				blends well with the more conceptual aspects of SI. It allows me to explore tech policy, data privacy, and has motivated me to pursue law so I can one day help shape tech policy that 
				protects consumers and holds massive corporations responsible for ethical use of private information. 	</p>

			<h2>Other interests</h2>
			<p> Outside of school I am a writer and the business manager for <a href="https://www.gargmag.com/">The Gargoyle</a> - A humor magazine at the University of Michigan. 
				I love comedy and writing jokes. One day I would love to perform stand up just once. My dream job second to being a lawyer is writing for a show like SNL or I Think You Should Leave.
